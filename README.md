# LSG

Paper: Boosting Accuracy and Efficiency for Vector Retrieval with Local Scaling Graph

## Overview of Contents

### DiskANN: DiskANN + LSG

The LSG algorithm is combined with the Vamana graph. For specific running instructions, refer to DiskANN/README.md.

### HNSW: HNSW (including PQ) + LSG

The LSG algorithm is combined with the HNSW and HNSWPQ methods from the Faiss library. For specific running instructions, refer to HNSW/README.md.

### NSG: NSG + LSG

The LSG algorithm is combined with the NSG method from the Faiss library. For specific running instructions, refer to NSG/README.md.
